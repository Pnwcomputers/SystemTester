## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Sysinternals tools not found"
**Solution:** Use launcher Menu Option 6 to auto-download, or manually download from [live.sysinternals.com](https://live.sysinternals.com)

### "Execution policy" errors
**Solution:** Use launcher Menu Option 4, or run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force`

### "Access denied" / Permission errors
**Solution:** Right-click launcher and choose "Run as administrator"

### Windows Update check fails
**Solution:** Ensure Windows Update service is running; may require administrator rights

### Tests taking too long
**Expected:** Some tests are intentionally slow:
- CPU Performance: 10 seconds
- Power/Energy Report: 15 seconds
- Windows Update Search: 30-60 seconds
- DISM/SFC Scans: 5-15 minutes
