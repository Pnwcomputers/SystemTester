**Thumb-drive friendly, no-install Windows hardware health check toolkit** powered by **Sysinternals** and **PowerShell**.

A zero-dependency **PowerShell solution** that runs a comprehensive, curated set of Sysinternals and Windows diagnostic tools. It then processes the raw data to produce two essential reports: a **Clean Summary Report** (human-readable, de-noised, with recommendations) and a **Detailed Report** (cleaned tool outputs).

**The essential utility for:**
* Field diagnostics and client handoff reports.
* Establishing a system baseline health check.
* Quickly identifying performance bottlenecks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Batch Launcher (Recommended)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Run `SystemTester.bat` (will request admin elevation)
3. Choose **Option 5** to auto-download Sysinternals Suite (first time only)
4. Choose **Option 6** to set up GPU testing tools (optional)
5. Choose **Option 1** for interactive menu or **Option 2** to run all tests
6. Reports are saved in the script directory

### Option B: Direct PowerShell

```powershell
# Interactive menu
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\SystemTester.ps1

# Run all tests automatically
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\SystemTester.ps1 -AutoRun
```

> ℹ️ **Launcher compatibility:** The batch launcher automatically detects either `SystemTester_FIXED.ps1` or the legacy `SystemTester.ps1` filename, so both naming conventions continue to work.

### **First-Time Setup**

If Sysinternals tools are missing:
1. **Automatic:** Use launcher Menu Option 5 to download (~35 MB)
2. **Manual:** Download from [live.sysinternals.com](https://live.sysinternals.com), extract to `.\Sysinternals\`

For enhanced GPU testing:
1. **NVIDIA GPUs:** Install latest NVIDIA drivers (includes nvidia-smi)
2. **AMD GPUs:** Install latest AMD drivers
3. **GPU-Z (Optional):** Use launcher Menu Option 6 → 1 to download

2. **Run ALL Tests Automatically** — Complete system scan with auto-report
3. **Fix PowerShell Execution Policy** — Set CurrentUser to RemoteSigned
4. **Verify Tool Integrity** — Check digital signatures and file sizes (FIXED: now works!)
5. **Download/Update Sysinternals Suite** — Auto-download from Microsoft (~35 MB)
6. **GPU Testing Tools Manager** — Download and manage GPU testing tools
   - GPU-Z installation assistant (with size validation)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Sysinternals tools not found"
**Solution:** Use launcher Menu Option 5 to auto-download, or manually download from [live.sysinternals.com](https://live.sysinternals.com)

### "Execution policy" errors
**Solution:** Use launcher Menu Option 3, or run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force`

### "Access denied" / Permission errors
**Solution:** Right-click launcher and choose "Run as administrator"

### Script crashes immediately on startup (v2.4 original only)
**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Use `SystemTester.ps1` instead. Original had missing `Initialize-Environment` function.

### Tool verification (Menu Option 4) crashes
**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Use `SystemTester.bat` and `SystemTester.ps1`. Missing function has been added.

### AMD GPU not detected (multi-GPU systems)
**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Script now checks ALL registry subkeys (\0000, \0001, \0002, etc.), not just \0000.

### GPU-Z appears corrupted
**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Launcher now validates file size (should be >1MB). Re-download if size is too small.

### SMART test runs DISM/SFC instead
**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - Incorrect code has been removed from SMART test function.

### Windows Update check fails
**Solution:** Ensure Windows Update service is running; may require administrator rights

### GPU tests show "SKIPPED"
**Solution:** 
- For NVIDIA: Install latest drivers from nvidia.com
- For AMD: Install latest drivers from amd.com/support
- nvidia-smi is included with NVIDIA drivers
- Some GPU tests don't require special tools and should always work
- **Note:** AMD detection now properly checks all registry locations

### Tests taking too long
**Expected:** Some tests are intentionally slow:
- CPU Performance: 10-30 seconds
- Power/Energy Report: 15-20 seconds (admin only)
- Windows Update Search: 30-90 seconds
- DISM/SFC Scans: 5-15 minutes each (admin only)
- DirectX Diagnostics (dxdiag): Up to 50 seconds

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Safety

* **Admin Rights:** Required for DISM, SFC, energy reports, SMART data, Windows Update queries
* **Report Contents:** Includes computer name, username, installed software paths, hardware details
* **Data Sensitivity:** Reports may reveal system configuration—review before sharing
* **No Telemetry:** Script does not send data anywhere; purely local operation
* **Auto-Download:** Only downloads from official Microsoft servers (download.sysinternals.com)
* **GPU Tools:** GPU-Z must be downloaded manually from techpowerup.com (launcher opens browser)
* **File Validation:** Tool integrity verification checks digital signatures and file sizes
