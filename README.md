## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Sysinternals tools not found"
**Solution:** Use launcher Menu Option 5 to auto-download, or manually download from [live.sysinternals.com](https://live.sysinternals.com)

### "Execution policy" errors
**Solution:** Use launcher Menu Option 3, or run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force`

### "Access denied" / Permission errors
**Solution:** Right-click launcher and choose "Run as administrator"

### Windows Update check fails
**Solution:** Ensure Windows Update service is running; may require administrator rights

### GPU tests show "SKIPPED"
**Solution:** 
- For NVIDIA: Install latest drivers from nvidia.com
- For AMD: Install latest drivers from amd.com/support
- nvidia-smi is included with NVIDIA drivers
- Some GPU tests don't require special tools and should always work

### Tests taking too long
**Expected:** Some tests are intentionally slow:
- CPU Performance: 10 seconds
- Power/Energy Report: 15 seconds (admin only)
- Windows Update Search: 30-90 seconds
- DISM/SFC Scans: 5-15 minutes each (admin only)
- DirectX Diagnostics (dxdiag): Up to 45 seconds

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Safety

* **Admin Rights:** Required for DISM, SFC, energy reports, SMART data, Windows Update queries
* **Report Contents:** Includes computer name, username, installed software paths, hardware details
* **Data Sensitivity:** Reports may reveal system configuration—review before sharing
* **No Telemetry:** Script does not send data anywhere; purely local operation
* **Auto-Download:** Only downloads from official Microsoft servers (download.sysinternals.com)
* **GPU Tools:** GPU-Z must be downloaded manually from techpowerup.com (launcher opens browser)
